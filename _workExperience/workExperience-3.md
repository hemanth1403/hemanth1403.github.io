excerpt: "The project aimed to enhance runway safety by detecting Foreign Object Debris (FOD) on airstrips, which can pose significant risks to aircraft during takeoff and landing. The FOD detection vehicle was designed to autonomously patrol the runway, capturing high-resolution images and processing them in real-time to identify potential hazards."

Developed a prototype i.e. FOD detection vehicle using an EV for wobble-free movement and Nvidia Jetson Xavier Nx in combination with e-con system cameras for live video processing and custom Yolov8 with hyperparameter tuning and fine-tuning for the detection.
The results were as follows :

- Achieved a Precision -> 0.93031
- Recall -> 0.88235
- F1 score -> 0.90569
  And a notable average FPS of around 21, when deployed.
